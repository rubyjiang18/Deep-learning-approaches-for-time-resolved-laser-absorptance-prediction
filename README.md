# Code release for model training

The folder "end_to_end_approach" has the code to train ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt-T for laser energy absorptance prediction. See README.md file in this folder for detailed documentataions.

The folder "semantic_segmentation" has the code to train segmentation models to segmentent keyholes from the x-ray images. The geometric features can be easily extracted from the keyhole segments. See README.md file in this folder for detailed documentataions.

The top-performing trained models for these two practice (ConvNeXt-T and UNet)can be found in this link (). You can load these weights for your down-stream tasks.
